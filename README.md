# Store-Item-Demand-Forecasting

## Business Problem
A chain of stores wants a 3-month demand forecast for its 10 different stores and 50 different products.

## Dataset History
This dataset is presented to test different time series techniques. A store chain's 5-year data includes information on 10 different stores and 50 different products.

## Project Tasks
Create a 3-month demand forecasting model for the relevant store chain using the following time series and machine learning techniques.
* Random Noise
* Lag/Shifted Features
* Rolling Mean Features
* Exponentially Weighted Mean Features
* Custom Cost Function (SMAPE)
* LightGBM ile Model Validation
